### User Stories

As a **reviewer**, I want to:
- determine if my reviews are consistently too strict or too lenient, in order to avoid extremes.
- assess if my reviews are detailed enough, in order to decide if I need to spend more time on them.
- be informed if I am slower in responding to code reviews compared to other reviewers, so I can improve my speed.
- avoid integrating this tool into CI, so I have the option to use the utility anonymously.
- be aware of the number of code reviews performed by each reviewer, in order to make informed decisions about my own workload.
- use this tool with any major code hosting platform.

As a **manager**, I want to:
- identify if there are any reviewers exhibiting bias towards specific developers, in order to understand and resolve the issue.
- gain insight into how my team operates, in order to have context during interactions with developers.
- compare different repositories, to evaluate teams between each other.
- find aggressive conversations (semantic analysis), to understand and resolve the root cause.
