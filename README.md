## Code Review Stats

Show statistics about Code Reviews on GitHub.

### User Stories
As a **reviewer**, I want to:
- know if I am too strict or too forgiving in my reviews, so that I can avoid extremes
- know if I am too unresponsive compared to others, so that I can do code review faster
- avoid integrating this utility, so that I can check statistics anonymously
- know how many code reviews each reviewer does, so that I can decide if I should do more reviews or less
- get stats from popular code hosting platforms, so that I can use this tool

As a **manager**, I want to:
- know if there are reviewers with a bias towards certain developers, so that I can understand and resolve the problem
- understand how team works, so that I have a context whenever I talk with developers
